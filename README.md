# Wheel Of Fortune Analysis

## About this repository
I was a Wheel of Fortune contestant on the January 22nd, 2025 episode, which taped on December 11th, 2024. When I got the news in mid-November, I started a month of intense studying and preparation. Nearly all of the materials I created to study are included here. I hope they help another future contestant, or another data-driven Wheel of Fortune fan like me!
